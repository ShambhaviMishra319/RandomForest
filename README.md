# Random Forest Classifier (Work in Progress)

This repository contains a work-in-progress implementation of a **Random Forest Classifier** as part of my journey to master machine learning concepts. I am working on concepts like **hyperparameter tuning**, **data preprocessing**, and **model evaluation**.

## 📁 Files
- **RandomForest.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook containing the current progress of my Random Forest project.

## 📚 Learning Goals
- Understand how to preprocess data using `ColumnTransformer` (OneHotEncoding, StandardScaler, etc.)
- Learn hyperparameter tuning with `GridSearchCV`
- Build and evaluate a Random Forest Classifier

## 🛠️ Next Steps
- Improve the model's performance.
- Add visualization for hyperparameter tuning results.
- Document the key takeaways in this README.

Stay tuned for updates! 🚀
